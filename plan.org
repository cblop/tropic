** DONE bridges: just generate the ones we want (subtropes)
   CLOSED: [2017-05-22 Mon 12:28]
** TODO bridges: switch back to using perms rather than start events
We _have_ to do this, because any start event will trigger a violation in other institutions. As it _always_ happens, there will _always_ be a violation.
** TODO add fluents to code gen
** TODO what is up with argument order?
Must be happening in the instal.clj code generation stage
** TODO strip "The" from roles in solver.clj
** TODO get it working with multiple tropes at once
** TODO obls have no effect on the visualisation: change this
** DONE add support for multi-word verbs
   CLOSED: [2017-05-12 Fri 09:37]
** TODO add support for continuing branches after "or" rule
** TODO add subtropes to interface/solver
*** TODO put subtropes in separate argument array
(Actually, the other tropes will emerge as a "starting trope" checkbox in the interface)
*** TODO add subtrope to @our-tropes in storybuilder when trope is selected
("begin with this trope" won't be checked by default)
** TODO rename tropes so that they don't clash with char/item/object names
** TODO how can we get better error messages?
** TODO replace "when" with "if" (think about it first, though)
